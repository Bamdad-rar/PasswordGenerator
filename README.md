# personalized password generator

password generators found online usually get the task done but they are very much random(so that even remembering
them is a pain). what I am aiming for is to create more memorable and personalized passwords while keeping it 
random enough so that it wont be easily figured out.

this program will get some words from the user (or randomly pick up words from the dictionary) and begin 
randomization, while keeping and interactive process with the user. the user picks the methods and is
even able to edit the outcome of the password generator(which is advised for further randomness/personalization)
to their will.
